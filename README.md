# WPT_PID_CONTROLLER
This repository contains MATLAB code for modeling, simulating, and analyzing a Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) system using PID control. The project includes both symbolic and time-domain analysis of a coupled inductor system with capacitive compensation, focusing on voltage regulation at the receiver side.
